= Introduction =

This is WebRunner, a simple XULRunner application which implements a minimal web browser for use with your favorite web application. The code is based on [http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2007/03/site-specific-browser-using-webrunner/ this code] by Mark Finkle and Benjamin Smedberg.


= Details =

== Purpose ==
The main use for WebRunner is to experiment with XULRunner application development. There is very little functionality provided beyond an example application structure for an over-simplified web browser application.

== Online Application Wrapper ==
You might find WebRunner to be useful for wrapping an online application into it's own separate browser window with it's own unique process. This can make a web application feel more like a regular desktop application.

== Changes ==
The following changes have been made to the original WebRunner code:

 * Wrapped the app with a Mac OS X Application Bundle
 * Implemented a simple Preferences dialog
 * Created a spiffy [http://www.developerfriendly.com/files/nodeimage/1/eed425e1ed3386de91d307ed70d7781d_tn.png icon]
